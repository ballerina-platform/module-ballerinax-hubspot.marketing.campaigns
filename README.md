## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/our-story) is an AI-powered customer relationship management (CRM) platform. 

The `ballerinax/module-ballerinax-hubspot.marketing.campaigns` connector offers APIs to connect and interact with the [Hubspot Marketing Campaigns API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/api/marketing/campaigns) endpoints, specifically based on the [HubSpot REST API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/overview)

## Setup guide

To use the HubSpot Marketing Campaigns connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot App under it. Therefore you need to register for a developer account at HubSpot if you don't have one already.

### Step 1: Create/Login to a HubSpot Developer Account

If you have an account already, go to the [HubSpot developer portal](https://developers.hubspot.com/)

If you don't have a HubSpot Developer Account you can sign up to a free account [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)

### Step 2 (Optional): Create a [Developer Test Account](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/account-types#developer-test-accounts) under your account

Within app developer accounts, you can create developer test accounts to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.

> **Note**: These accounts are only for development and testing purposes. In production you should not use Developer Test Accounts.

   1. Go to Test accounts section from the left sidebar.

![Test Account](docs/Resources/testAccount.png)

   2. Click on the Create developer test account button on the top right corner.

![Development Test Account](docs/Resources/developmentTestAccount.png)

   3. In the pop-up window, provide a name for the test account and click on the Create button.

![Create Account](docs/Resources/createAccount.png)

   4. You will see the newly created test account in the list of test accounts.

![Test Account Portal](docs/Resources/testAccountPortal.png)

### Step 3: Create a HubSpot App

   1. Navigate to the Apps section from the left sidebar and click on the Create app button on the top right corner.

![App Section](docs/Resources/appSection.png)

   2. Provide a public app name and description for your app.

![Naming the App](docs/Resources/namingApp.png)

### Step 4: Setup Authentication

   1. Move to the Auth tab.

![Auth Section](docs/Resources/auth.png)

   2. In the Scopes section, add the following scopes for your app using the Add new scopes button.
        - `marketing.campaigns.read`
        - `marketing.campaigns.revenue.read`
        - `marketing.campaigns.write`

![Marketing Scopes](docs/Resources/marketingScopes.png)

   3. In the Redirect URL section, add the redirect URL for your app. This is the URL where the user will be redirected after the authentication process. You can use `localhost` for testing purposes. Then click the "Create App" button.

![Redirect URL](docs/Resources/redirectURL.png)

### Step 5: Get the Client ID and Client Secret

Navigate to the Auth tab and you will see the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for your app. Make sure to save these values.

![Client ID and Client Secret](docs/Resources/clientId_secretId.png)

### Step 6: Setup Authentication Flow

Before proceeding with the Quickstart, ensure you have obtained the Access Token using the following steps:

   1. Create an authorization URL using the following format:

      ```
      https://app.hubspot.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&scope=<YOUR_SCOPES>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>
      ```
   Replace the `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>`, `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>` and `<YOUR_SCOPES>` with your specific value.

   2. Paste it in the browser and select your developer test account to intall the app when prompted.

![Account Select](docs/Resources/accountSelect.png)

   3. A code will be displayed in the browser. Copy the code.

   4. Run the following curl command. Replace the `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>`, `<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>` and `<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>` with your specific value. Use the code you received in the above step 3 as the CODE below

   - Linux/macOS
   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
--url https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token \
--header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=<CODE>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
   ```
     
   - Windows
   ```bash
curl --request POST ^
--url https://api.hubapi.com/oauth/v1/token ^
--header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ^
--data 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=<CODE>&redirect_uri=<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
   ```

This command will return the access token necessary for API calls.

```json
{
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "<Refresh Token>",
  "access_token": "<Access Token>",
  "expires_in": 1800
}
```

   5. Store the access token securely for use in your application.


## Quickstart

To use the HubSpot Marketing Campaigns connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ballerinax/hubspot.marketing.campaigns` module and `ballerina/oauth2` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/hubspot.marketing.campaigns as hsmcampaigns;
import ballerina/oauth2;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

   1. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

```toml
 clientId = <Client Id>
 clientSecret = <Client Secret>
 refreshToken = <Refresh Token>
```

   2. Instantiate a `hsmcampaigns:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained credentials and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string clientId = ?;
configurable string clientSecret = ?;
configurable string refreshToken = ?;

final hsmcampaigns:ConnectionConfig hsmcampaignsConfig = {
    auth : {
        clientId,
        clientSecret,
        refreshToken,
        credentialBearer: oauth2:POST_BODY_BEARER
    }
};

final hsmcampaigns:Client hsmcampaignsClient = check new (hsmcampaignsConfig);
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations. A sample usecase is shown below.

Retrieve a Marketing Campaign

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    hsmcampaigns:CollectionResponseWithTotalPublicCampaignForwardPaging campaigns = check baseClient->/marketing/v3/campaigns.get();
}
```
